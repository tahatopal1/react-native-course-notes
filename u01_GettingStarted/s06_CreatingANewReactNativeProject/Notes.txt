### Setting Up a New React Native Project with Expo

#### Step 1: Install Node.js

* Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the **latest LTS version**.
* Node.js is required to:

  * Run the JavaScript environment used under the hood by Expo
  * Use the `npx` command to generate projects

---

### Step 2: Create a New Expo Project

#### Recommended Command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app rnCourse --template blank
```

* **`npx create-expo-app`**: Initializes a new Expo-based React Native project.
* **`--template blank`**: Ensures the project starts with a minimal setup (avoids TypeScript and extra boilerplate).
* **`rnCourse`**: Example project name (customizable).

#### Notes:

* Run the command in a terminal window inside the directory where you want the project to be created.
* A new folder named after the project (e.g., `rnCourse`) will be created.
* Inside, all necessary files and dependencies will be initialized.
* This process might take a few minutes.

### Additional Resource

* Visit [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) â€“ the official Expo website to:

  * Learn about Expo features
  * Understand CLI commands
  * Explore additional tools and services Expo provides

---

### After Installation

Once setup is complete, Expo will show suggested next steps:

* Navigate into the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd rnCourse
  ```
* Run the app using:

  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```

> However, these commands won't be executed immediately in the course. Instead, the instructor will guide through project structure and files first.

---

### Platform Focus

* **Only Android and iOS** platforms will be covered in this course.
* **Web platform support via Expo** will be ignored, as the focus is strictly on mobile development.
