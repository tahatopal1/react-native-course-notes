### Setting Up Device Preview and Emulators in React Native (with Expo)

#### Real-Time Preview with Expo Go App

* You can **preview your app live** on a real mobile device using the **Expo Go** app.
* Expo Go is available for **both Android and iOS** via their respective app stores.
* Run the following command in your terminal to start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
* A QR code is generated. Scan it with:

  * **Android**: Built-in QR scanner in Expo Go.
  * **iOS**: Native **Camera app**, then open the link in **Expo Go**.

### Emulators & Simulators for Local Testing

#### 🟢 Android Emulator (Cross-platform)

1. Download **Android Studio** from: [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Open Android Studio → **More Actions** → **Virtual Device Manager**
3. Click **Create Device**, choose a template (e.g., Pixel 5), and pick an API level (e.g., API 32).
4. **Important**: Choose a template **with the Google Play Store icon** so it can install Expo Go.
5. Launch the emulator.
6. In the terminal running `npm start`, press:

   ```bash
   A
   ```

   * This installs Expo Go and opens the app automatically in the emulator.

#### 🍎 iOS Simulator (Mac Only)

1. **macOS only**: Install **Xcode** via the Mac App Store.
2. Open **Xcode → Preferences → Locations** → set **Command Line Tools**.
3. Open iOS Simulator from:

   ```
   Applications → Xcode → Show Package Contents → Contents → Developer → Applications → Simulator
   ```
4. Run the simulator (e.g., iPhone 13).
5. In the terminal running `npm start`, press:

   ```bash
   I
   ```

   * This installs and launches Expo Go on the iOS simulator.

> ⚠ iOS simulators **are not supported on Windows or Linux** due to Apple restrictions. However, building real iOS apps on those platforms is possible using cloud-based build tools.

### Development Workflow Tips

* Keep the Expo development server (`npm start`) **running at all times** during development.
* When the server is running, your code updates will be **hot reloaded** into the app automatically on connected devices/simulators.
* Press:

  * `R` in the terminal to **manually reload** apps.
  * `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.
* You can serve **Android and iOS previews simultaneously** on their respective simulators.

### Summary Environment

| Preview Method       | Platform    | Requirements                      |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Expo Go (Device)** | Android/iOS | Mobile device + Expo Go app       |
| **Android Emulator** | All OSes    | Android Studio + Play Store image |
| **iOS Simulator**    | macOS only  | Xcode + Simulator tool            |

> This setup forms the **React Native development environment** for the course—enabling rapid testing and debugging on real devices and virtual emulators.
