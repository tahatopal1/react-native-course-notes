### Previewing a React Native App with Expo

#### Goal

Enable **real-time preview** of the app during development—similar to how React apps are previewed in the browser.

---

### Using the Expo Go App for Live Preview

#### Step 1: Install Expo Go on Your Mobile Device

* Available for both **Android** and **iOS**
* Search for and install **"Expo Go"** from your app store

---

### Step 2: Start the Expo Development Server

* Open a terminal in your project directory (e.g., inside VS Code)
* Run:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```
* This launches the **Expo Development Server**, which:

  * Watches your code
  * Builds JavaScript bundles
  * Displays a **QR code** in the terminal and a browser tab

---

### Step 3: Connect Your Device

#### On Android:

* Open the **Expo Go app**
* Tap the **Scan QR Code** option
* Scan the QR from the terminal or browser
* Your app will load immediately

#### On iPhone (iOS):

* Use the **native Camera app** to scan the QR code
* Tap the notification that appears
* Grant permissions if prompted
* App opens in Expo Go automatically

---

### Live Reloading in Action

* Any changes saved in your code (e.g., updating text to `"Hello, World"`) are **instantly reflected** in the app on your device.
* No need for manual rebuilding or reinstallation.

### Summary

| Tool            | Purpose                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Expo Go App** | View the app on real device             |
| **Expo CLI**    | Start local development server          |
| **QR Code**     | Bridge between local machine and device |

> This seamless workflow is a key benefit of using Expo—allowing fast development, testing, and debugging of React Native apps directly on physical devices without emulator setup.
